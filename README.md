- 👋 Hi, I’m Yash Varma
- 👀 I’m interested in Development and Data Structure in general but also getting my hands on LLMs like the most obvious one: chatgbt and other like pieces for developers, code pen, google bard etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN and DSA C++ without using chatgbt; as at first, the basics must be on the tip.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various platform like linkedin, github and to create something valuable for myself as well as others usage. Will upload on github soon:) my newbie ideas~
